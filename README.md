## Website Creation Process and Challenges

This website was created as a personal portfolio to showcase Maxine's projects and serve as a starting point for her web development journey. Here's an overview of the major steps and milestones involved in the website creation process:

1. **Inspiration and Planning**: Maxine spent the first day finding inspiration for the project, determining the theme, and researching existing portfolio websites. She planned the overall structure and layout of the website.
2. **Development and Design**: Maxine used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with React.js to build the website. She leveraged frameworks like Email.js and Midjourney for specific functionalities. Maxine processed images using Midjourney and designed the layout of each page.
3. **Responsive Design**: Maxine dedicated significant time (Days 2-6) to make the entire website responsive, ensuring optimal viewing experience across different devices. This involved refining the CSS, adjusting margins and positioning, and implementing media queries.
4. **Challenges and Obstacles**: Maxine encountered several challenges throughout the development process. Learning to use React.js and understanding web development, UI/UX design, and creating animations were initial obstacles. Additionally, setting up GitHub, version control, custom domains, and hosting on GitHub Pages posed challenges.
5. **Overcoming Challenges**: Maxine sought help from various resources, including ChatGPT and W3Schools. She also learned from UI/UX TikToks and gathered feedback from friends to improve the user experience. Googling specific topics and looking at other websites for inspiration were instrumental in overcoming challenges.
6. **Lessons and Insights**: Maxine gained valuable insights from the website creation journey, particularly in understanding user experience and incorporating feedback. She realized the importance of considering the user's perspective and found the process of translating design concepts into code more challenging than expected.
